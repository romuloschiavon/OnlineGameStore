<p align="center"><strong>VAPOR</strong></p>

Vapor is the final project developed for my Database I course on UFSC. The projects was developed using python and postgresql, and it has the purpose of copying a few funcionalities of Steam. 

The main idea of the project was to design the conceptual model and the logic model of the database, create an application that communicates with the database (realizes inserts/updates/deletes) and return in some way a graph of selections that had a meaning on the long run.

## Conceptual model

The main ideia of the conceptual model was to revolve around the game (jogo). The issue to be altered in the application is generating orders with dates. As of right now it has a lot of problemns exceptionally when the order has a lot of itens, packages (expansions) and games.
The favorite list (Lista de Desejos) has issues and it should be changed as well.

## Logic Model

The ideia of the logic model is to work around the errors of the conceptual model, so that the application can be runned even with the errors that should be fixed later.
